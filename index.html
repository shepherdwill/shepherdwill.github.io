            <h3>The productivity context</h3>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The UK productivity slowdown has been widely documented. Since 2007, productivity growth has been extremely weak falling significantly below the trend line of past productivity performance.

                Why should we be concerned about low productivity growth? It directly translates to stagnant real wages and prevents further increases in living standards. At a time when demands on public finances are increasing in advanced economies, low productivity growth also hampers tax revenues to pay for these rising obligations.
            </p>
            <p> A number of explanations have been offered ...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chronic underinvestment from both private and public sectors</li>
                <li>The long tail of unproductive firms</li>
                <li>Skill gaps and labour market issues</li>
                <li>The legacy of the 2008 Financial Crisis</li>

            <h3>What does dynamism mean?</h3>
            <p> A dynamic economy is one which is changing and responding to the wider environment. This change may take place at a sectoral level as industries grow and shrink, or it may take place at the firm level as companies change size.

        <figure id="Location2"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
        <p>Dynamism can come from new businesses opening, businesses closing down or existing businesses changing the amount of labour they employ.</p>

        vegaEmbed('#Location2', figure_2_spec)

        // Do you want to add more graphs?
        // try defining a new variable for figure_3_spec, adding VegaEmbed for Location3, and adding a new section in the HTML

        // var figure_3_spec = ...
        // vegaEmbed('#Location3', figure_3_spec)
